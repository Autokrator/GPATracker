# GPATracker

TODO:
- Fix semester button always being on top.
- Add animations between clicking semester and opening fragment.
- Implement local storage save functionality (just need to save the array of semesters).
- Implement 'add course' functionality.
- Add TextView to either MainActivity or fragment to display GPA.
- Back button should direct users back to semesters screen.

Optional:
- Custom templates for different universities (grading scale for sure but also possibly color scheme).
